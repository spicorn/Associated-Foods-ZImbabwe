                <h3>
                  Spear Capital investment to increase AFZ's production 75pc
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Associated Foods Zimbabwe (AFZ), a prominent food processing
                  company in Zimbabwe, has secured an undisclosed equity
                  investment from Spear Capital. The investment will enable AFZ
                  to increase its capacity utilization from 35 percent to 75
                  percent. AFZ is known for its Mama's and Farmgold product
                  lines, which encompass a range of food products such as peanut
                  butter, jams, snacks, cereals, baked beans, and canned goods.
                  The funding from Spear Capital will be used to enhance AFZ's
                  operations and environmental impact, allowing the company to
                  expand its presence not only in Zimbabwe but also in the
                  region. AFZ also plans to allocate a portion of the investment
                  towards supporting local smallholder farmers through an
                  out-grower scheme. Currently, AFZ collaborates with 1,100
                  self-funding farmers, and with the injection of capital from
                  Spear Capital, they anticipate increasing this number to 2,500
                  farmers, with a focus on empowering women, who make up 60
                  percent of the farmers. Spear Capital views AFZ as a strategic
                  partner due to its association with major food suppliers in
                  Zimbabwe, providing a secure entry into the country's
                  high-growth market. The investment is expected to create more
                  opportunities for AFZ to supply goods to consumers and
                  capitalize on the lucrative regional market. Under the Mama's
                  brand, AFZ offers a diverse portfolio of products, including
                  peanut butter, mixed fruit jam, sweet orange marmalade,
                  cornflakes, popsnacks, and puffed kurls. The Farmgold brand
                  specializes in tomato puree and other related products.

                <h3>Associated Foods of Zimbabwe eyes export markets</h3>
                <p>
                  HARARE - Associated Foods of Zimbabwe (AFZ), a food
                  manufacturing company, has announced its intention to enter
                  the export market due to a significant increase in its
                  production capacity. The company's production levels have
                  surged by 600 percent, from 40 tonnes per month to 280-350
                  tonnes of foodstuffs, thanks to a $2 million fund from
                  Norfund. This growth is attributed to the ISO 22000
                  certification, which ensures world-class manufacturing
                  processes and safety. With this certification, AFZ aims to
                  expand its reach into the regional and international markets,
                  targeting countries such as Botswana, South Africa, Zambia,
                  and the SADC region as a whole. AFZ processes and distributes
                  various food products under brands like Mama's, Farmgold, and
                  Sunbird, including natural fruit jams, peanut butter, canned
                  fruits, processed tomatoes, and more. ISO 22000 certification
                  demonstrates an organization's ability to control food safety
                  hazards, guaranteeing the safety of its products for
                  consumption.
